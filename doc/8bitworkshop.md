# 8bitworkshop IDE and Javatari Emulator

[Back to Notes](./notes.md)

## Javatari Emulator

You can alternatively use a web-based emulator called [Javatari]. This is also a
great option for sharing your Atari ROMs with your friends.

## 8bitworkshop IDE

A website called [8bitworkshop] was created by Steven Hug, includes great book
options on writing games for the Atari. The website also includes a
[web-based IDE] for 8 bit systems such as the Atari 2600 (VCS), NES, Bally
Astrocade, Sega systems, Commodore 64, Apple ][+, Arcade systems, and
x86 (Free DOS). The VCS assembly uses the Javatari emulator to run the ROMs
you create.

You can see the OP code representations of the assembly commands on the left.

At the top of the IDE, the first button with a circular arrow icon can be
clicked to reset the ROM execution. You can use the other buttons to run through
the steps of your code.

You can use the display in the bottom-right corner of the editor to view the
CPU registrers, Memory Stack, PIA and TIA registers.
